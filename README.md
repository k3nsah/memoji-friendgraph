# Memoji Friendgraph

The idea was to create a simple, undirected, graph of some of my friends in the CS, ITI, and Engineering communities. I wanted a way to visually represent my semi-professional `network` of people in the form of a fun project. You can view a [live demo](https://www.kelcimensah.dev/projects/friendgraph) to see how it looks.

## Setup
This project uses the [Vis.js](https://visjs.org/) javascript library to build the interactive graph and Apple's trademarked [Memoji](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208986) stickers as personalized image nodes to represent each person.

## Future Updates
- [ ] convert nodes to become clickable
- [ ] reorganize order of edges for neatness

## Resources
